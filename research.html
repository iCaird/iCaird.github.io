    Work in progress! My goal is to populate this page with some informal ramblings about my research, adjacent topics, and maybe just things
    that are interesting to me. To start here is a list of things I'm interested in:
    <ul>
    <li>Cluster algebras</li>
    <li>Grassmannians and the cluster structure on their coordinate rings</li>
    <li>Combinatorics, particularly those associated with the above</li>
    <li>Categorification (of the cluster structure on Grassmannian coordinate rings)</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="border-width: 2px; border-color: black; border-radius: 25px; border-style: solid">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; line-height: 50px;">What is a cluster algebra?</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
            Typically to describe a ring or an algebra to someone, you would present them with a full set of generators
            and provide relations between them under the appropriate operations. Things are not as simple 
            or as courteous with cluster algebras...
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
            To describe a cluster algebra, you first provide an initial <em>seed</em> that contains <em>some</em>
            generators. You then provide rules for how you can <em>mutate</em> a seed to obtain a new seeds. You
            repeat this (possibly infinite) process starting with the initial seed. You then collect all the elements
            from all seeds into a set and generate an algebra from them.
        </p>

        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
            These rules for mutation can be encoded in a quiver associated to the initial seed. This quiver is also
            mutated between each seed.

    <h2 style="text-align: center; line-height: 50px;">What is a Grassmannian?</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
            Given $k,n \in \mathbb{N}$, with $k \leq n$, the Grassmannian $Gr(k,n)$ is defined as the set of k-dimensional subspaces
            in $\mathbb{C}^n$, i.e. $$Gr(k,n) = \{V \leq \mathbb{C}^n \mid \mathrm{dim}\,V = k\}$$
            How can we describe an element of a Grassmannian? Let's consider $Gr(2,4)$. We can take a max rank $2 \times 4$ matrix
            $$A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c & d \\ e & f & g & h \end{pmatrix}$$ and consider its row span. Since A has rank 2, its row span
            is a 2-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{C}^4$, i.e. it determines an element $V \in Gr(2,4)$.
